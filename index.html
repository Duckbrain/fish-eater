                        <h3>How to play Fish Eater:</h3>
                        <p>
                            In Fish Eater you play as a little fish in a big pond. You must become the best by becoming the biggest.
                            Fish Eater is mainly played by using either the <i class="fa fa-arrows"></i> arrow keys; the W, A, S, and D keys; or the new <i class="fa fa-mobile"></i> touch screen joystick.
                            You may use the keys to move in any direction in the water. Your goal is simple: eat
                            smaller fish to become bigger. Fish are colored according to if you may eat them or not.
                        </p>
						<h4>Controls</h4>
						<ul class="fa-ul">
							<li><i class="fa fa-li fa-keyboard-o"></i> The directional arrow keys or the WASD keys can be used to control the fish</li>

						</ul>
                        <p>The colorings are as follows.</p>

					   <h3>Version 4.0.0</h3>
					   <p>Fish Eater is a little game developed by me, Jonathan Duck, for free of charge. Up to this point I have received no compensation for this work, but I do plan to add some ads, so please bear with me when I do.</p>
					   <p>Technical: Fish Eater was first written in C# as a quick little game drawn with GDI+. When I read about HTML5 and the canvas, I decided to try it out. The first release of the Chrome App was a litteral copy and paste, then patch it up just enough to work in JavaScript. It has since been rewritten from scratch.</p>
					   <h3>What's New</h3>
					   <h4>4.0.0</h4>
					   <ul>
					   	<li>Complete Rewrite</li>
					   	<li>This About Screen you are looking at</li>
						<li>Touch screen support</li>
						<li>*Fast has been toned down!</li>
						<li>No more Spawn powerup. It may or may not come back.</li>
						<li>Lots of pretty icons thanks to <i class="fa fa-flag"></i> Font Awesome</li>
					   </ul>
